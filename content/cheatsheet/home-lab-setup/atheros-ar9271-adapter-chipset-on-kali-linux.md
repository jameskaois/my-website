### 🌐 About This Project

When I started learning wireless pentesting, I discovered that **Atheros AR9271-based adapters** are one of the most recommended options for Linux users. They have **native Linux support**, excellent **monitor mode** and **packet injection** capabilities, and are **widely used in ethical hacking labs**.

I'm currently using this wireless adapter chipset with my [TP-LINK Archer T2U Plus](https://github.com/jameskaois/tplink-archer-t2uplus-kali-linux) for **ethical hacking**.

### ⚙️ Setup on Kali Linux

#### 🐧 Tested On

-   Kali Linux 2023.4 & 2024.1
-   Kernel 6.x
-   Works out-of-the-box on most Debian-based distros

#### 🔧 Step-by-Step Setup

##### 1. Update Your System

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

##### 2. Plug In Your Adapter

Check if it's detected:

```bash
lsusb | grep Atheros
```

You should see something like:

```bash
Bus 002 Device 003: ID 0cf3:9271 Qualcomm Atheros Communications AR9271 802.11n
```

##### 3. Verify Wireless Interface

```bash
iwconfig
```

Look for a wireless interface like `wlan0`.

#### 🧪 Using Monitor Mode & Packet Injection

Enable monitor mode:

```bash
sudo ip link set wlan0 down
sudo iw dev wlan0 set type monitor
sudo ip link set wlan0 up
```

Test packet injection:

```bash
sudo aireplay-ng --test wlan0
```
