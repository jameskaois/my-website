## About My Homelab

My home lab is my personal playground for learning and experimenting.  
Itâ€™s where I break things, fix them, and gain hands-on experience with the tools and technologies that are essential in cybersecurity and IT.

Instead of just reading about concepts, I test them in practice â€” in a safe, controlled environment.

---

## Why I Built It

-   To practice **ethical hacking** and **CTF challenges** in a safe way.
-   To understand **networking** beyond theory.
-   To simulate real-world **attacks and defenses**.
-   To get comfortable with **system administration** tasks.

A homelab gives me freedom: if I mess something up, I can just reset it without fear of breaking my main computer.

## Devices in My Homelab

![My Home Lab Setup](/images/posts/my-home-lab-cover.png)

### MacBook Air (M1)

-   **Specs:** M1 (ARM64), 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD
-   **Role:** Main device â€” primary machine for running most VMs and day-to-day hacking work.
-   **Notes:**
    -   Runs ARM-compatible images (e.g. Kali ARM64).
    -   I rely on snapshots and fast backups because this is the device I use most.
    -   Careful with heavy parallel VMs due to 8 GB RAM â€” I usually run 1â€“2 lightweight VMs simultaneously.

### MacBook Pro (2018)

-   **Specs:** Intel i5, 8/16 GB (depending on model), 256 GB SSD
-   **Role:** Secondary machine for browsing, research, and other tasks (including dark-web exploration in isolated VMs).
-   **Notes:**
    -   Good for running x86 VMs (Metasploitable, Windows).
    -   Keep isolation: use separate VM networks and avoid sharing host folders when researching risky content.

### Vsmart Joy 3

-   **Role:** Mobile device used for penetration testing (on-device testing, mobile recon, app testing).
-   **Notes:**
    -   Useful for testing mobile-specific behaviors and recon tools.
    -   Always factory-reset or isolate before/after sensitive testing.

### USB Wireless Adapters

-   **TP-LINK Archer T2U Plus**

    -   **Role:** Wireless adapter used for network hacking, supports monitor mode and packet sniffing in many Linux distributions.
    -   **Notes:** Works great as a USB adapter for Kali; ensure drivers are installed and you attach it to the VM (USB passthrough).

-   **Custom Atheros AR9271**
    -   **Role:** My preferred adapter for soft packet sniffing, AP mode, and general wireless experimentation.
    -   **Notes:** Atheros chips have great Linux support; ideal for Aircrack-ng, hostapd, and related tools.

## VMs I Run

-   **Kali Linux 2025 (ARM64)**

    -   Primary pentest distribution on the M1. Includes tooling for network, web, and wireless testing.
    -   Tip: use lightweight desktop (XFCE) or headless setups to save RAM.

-   **Metasploitable 3**

    -   Vulnerable target VMs for safe practice of exploitation techniques. Run in an isolated network or NAT mode.

-   **Windows 11 Home Edition**
    -   Use for testing Windows-specific tools, payloads, and for malware/behavior analysis within an isolated VM. Snapshot before/after experiments.

## What I Do in the Lab

-   TryHackMe & OverTheWire challenges & other CTFs challenges.
-   Network scanning and enumeration
-   Building small services (web, database) and securing them
-   Testing & learning tools like Wireshark, Burp Suite, Hydra, Nmap, etc.

## Closing Thoughts

This homelab isnâ€™t about having the latest hardware.  
Itâ€™s about creating an environment where I can **fail, learn, and grow** as a cybersecurity student.

> A homelab is like a gym for your technical skills â€” the more you train, the stronger you get. ğŸ’»ğŸ”¥
