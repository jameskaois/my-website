**=> Answer: `2017`**

-   <p>According to the Unified Kill Chain, how many phases are there to an attack?</p>

**=> Answer: `18`**

-   <p>What is the name of the attack phase where an attacker employs techniques to evade detection?</p>

**=> Answer: `Defense Evasion`**

-   <p>What is the name of the attack phase where an attacker employs techniques to remove data from a network?<br /></p>

**=> Answer: `Exfiltration`**
